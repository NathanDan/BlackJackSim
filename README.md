**BlackJackSim**

BlackJackSim is a Python Simulation of the card game Black-Jack that has solely been developed to test the SAS Viya Workbench platform. It takes a standard 52 card deck and the Black-Jack game logic to create a realistic simulation, that creates a win/loss/draw outcomes and displays them as a percentage at the end. The number of simulations can be changed to test the platform further and create insights into the game that can be used to create data analytics. 

This Python Simulation has been developed in Jupyter Notebook within the SAS Viya Workbench platform.
